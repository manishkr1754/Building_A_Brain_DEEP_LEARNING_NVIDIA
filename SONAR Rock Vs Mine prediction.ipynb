The project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between metal cylinders(mines) and rocks based on SONAR return data.\n\n## 2) Understanding Data\n---\n\nThe project is based on SONAR return data. Each data point consists of a set of 60 numerical values ranging between 0 to 1 representing the energy within specific frequency bands over time. The labels are 'M' for mines and 'R' for rock. The numbers in the labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the angle directly.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3) Getting System
